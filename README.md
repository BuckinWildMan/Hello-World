# Hello-World
Hello World, yes it is I your pupil
I am learning all the time, and sadly sometimes I learn things I didn't want to know.
Education is a good thing most times but when used to abuse it can be a lesson for both the student and the teacher.  Tread lightly as you consider your knowledge and how you might use is at it, like a weapon can be turned and used against you.
